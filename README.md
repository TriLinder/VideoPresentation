# VideoPresentation

  

A simple app to pause a video at predifined keyframes to create "slides" in a presentation.

  

**How to use:**

    1. Clone the repository

    2. Install `requirements.txt` 

    3. Run `main.py`

    4. **Done!** You should now be able to reach the demo on `localhost:5000/demo`

  

**Customizing:**

    Customizing is pretty self-explanatory, to create your own presentations:

    1. Create a new directory inside the existing directory  `presentation`

    2. Inside your new directory create a `video.mp4` file with your video

    3. Create a `keyframe.txt` file with the slide keyframes in the video (in seconds)

    4. **Done!** you should now find your new presentation at `localhost:5000/yourDirName`
